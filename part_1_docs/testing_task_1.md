### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
# there is no semi colon after else, the = should be ==

   

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2  
# def is mispelled as dif, there is no comma between card1 and card2, card is not initialised, the if isnt't indented correctly, card isn't initialised.


def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
# total is not initialised
  
```
